weather.py
Weather info for trip planning, shown alongside the hotel/taxi step
since that's where the darshan date is already fixed.

Two sources:
1. LIVE FORECAST - Open-Meteo (https://open-meteo.com), a free
   weather API that needs no API key. Only used for dates within its
   forecast window (roughly the next 16 days) since no forecast API
   is meaningfully accurate much further out than that.
2. SEASONAL AVERAGE - a small, real, researched table of Katra/Jammu
   monthly climate patterns, used as a fallback for dates beyond the
   forecast window, or if the live API call fails for any reason
   (no network, timeout, rate limit, etc). This always succeeds, so
   the app never breaks if this feature is used offline.

Coordinates used are for Katra town (the pilgrim base town), not the
Bhawan shrine itself (~5,200 ft up the trek route, which runs several
degrees cooler and can see winter snow even when Katra town doesn't -
this distinction is called out in the advisory text below).

Seasonal figures are grounded in real, well-documented climate
patterns for this part of the Trikuta Hills / Jammu region:
- Summers (Apr-Jun) are hot, peaking around 35°C in June before the
  monsoon breaks.
- The monsoon (Jul-Sep) brings heavy rain, with July typically the
  wettest month; the trek route can see slippery conditions and
  occasional landslide-related closures in this window.
- Autumn (Oct-Nov) is widely regarded as the most pleasant and driest
  window for the yatra.
- Winters (Dec-Feb) are cold and can be foggy; the Bhawan shrine
  (much higher altitude than Katra town) occasionally sees light snow.
This is general seasonal guidance, not a precise forecast - actual
conditions vary year to year.
